# Dungeons & Dragons combat simulator
## Introduction
This is meant to be a very basic combat simulator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.

This takes into consideration, mostly, physical attacks and damage spells.

There is no logic for support spells or condition spells.

It gathers statistics about the combat and a rate of success, which could be greater due to the limitations of the program.

## Installation of the program
First of all, this is a python program with no dependency on external libraries, except for pytest for testing.
